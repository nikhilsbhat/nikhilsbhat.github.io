This interacts with GoCD server&#39;s api to collect metrics, also monitors pipeline directories specified when deployed in GoCD server. It schedules both metric collections from GoCD server and pipeline size as cron to reduce resource spike when /metrics is invoked. Most importantly disk check is an expensive operation which can spike resource consumption, by doing this way load on the platform exporter is running can be reduced.</description></item></channel></rss>
