            <description>The helm plugin that helps in identifying deviations(mostly due to in-place edits) in the
                configurations that are deployed via helm chart. Kubernetes&#39; resources can be deployed via package
                manager helm, it is easier to deploy but to manage the same require more effort. If helm is used,
                strictly all resources should be managed by helm itself, but there are places where manual interventions
                are needed. This results in configuration drift from helm charts deployed.

            <description>Identifying all images just before the deployment of the helm chart is not a straightforward
                task. To make it simple, the helm plugin is leveraged. This can be installed as an add-on to the helm.
                It helps in filtering images based on the Kubernetes type. It also helps in filtering images based on a
                registry which it is part of.

            <title>Identifying drifts from deployed helm releases</title>
            <link>https://nikhilsbhat.github.io/blog/helm-drift/</link>

            <description>There is no native Helm way of identifying the drifts in the releases deployed via Helm. Now we
                have a Helm plugin to identify the drifts from the Helm releases deployed in the cluster.
                https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm-plugin/helm-drift/drift Just to share context on why this was
                created. We do in-place edits of resources a lot of times but forget to add the value back to the
                codebase; these edits go unnoticed and get overridden in the next deployment, which might screw up the
                environment if the edited changes are required.
