The initial version of the Terragen was just a one-time scaffold generator for Hashicorp Terraform, a custom provider with limited features.
While working on operators for Kubernetes, I bumped into frameworks such as Kubebuilder and operator-sdk.
The idea for the latest version of Terragen is derived from such frameworks.
Terragen Terraform is one of the best tools available to automate infrastructure, and there is no procrastination in accepting this fact.</description></item></channel></rss>
