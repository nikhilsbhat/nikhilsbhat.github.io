                automate the day to day tasks in their respective projects is quite challenging.

                terminologies of calling the same resurce. Seeing all these started working on Neuron.

            <description>It is difficult to switch context of different kubernetes clusters hosted in GCP projects. If
                one has to connect cluster using gcloud, will end up runnig multiple gcloud commands and is painful
                task.
                Yeah GCP has a option of cloud shell, where one can connect to the cluster hassle-free. Its little hard
                if we have to connect locally from our machines.
                Config solves exactly the same thing, by letting one to switch the cluster in one command.
