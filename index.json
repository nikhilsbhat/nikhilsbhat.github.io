This interacts with GoCD server's api to collect metrics, also monitors pipeline directories specified when deployed in GoCD server.

Most importantly disk check is an expensive operation which can spike resource consumption, by doing this way load on the platform exporter is running can be reduced.

These changes can be overridden by next helm release, what if the required changes are lost before adding it back to helm chart? This helm plugin is intended to solve the same problem by validating the resources that are part of appropriate chart/release against kubernetes.
