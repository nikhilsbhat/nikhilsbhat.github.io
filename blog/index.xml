Now we have a Helm plugin to identify the drifts from the Helm releases deployed in the cluster. https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm-plugin/helm-drift/drift Just to share context on why this was created. We do in-place edits of resources a lot of times but forget to add the value back to the codebase; these edits go unnoticed and get overridden in the next deployment, which might screw up the environment if the edited changes are required.</description></item></channel></rss>
